## Introduction

This project is focused on the segmentation of pine seedlings. We have many photos of planters with pine seedlings from three population of scots pine (Pinus sylvestrris). The main goal is to standardize images to make them comparable, segment seedlings, and determine their average color.

## Features

List key features of your project.

- Standardization of images using white reference
- Image transformation
- Image splitting
- Image segmentation using YOLOv7
- Backround removal
- Image composing
- Overlay of individual outputs
- Identification of individual seedlings and acquisition of RGB values
